## Hi there 👋, I'm Lebs from LebsLabsLink

Aspiring **Solidity & Blockchain Developer** based in Malta 🇲🇹.

Currently building my skills in Ethereum smart contract development with a focus on secure, real-world dApps.

### 🚀 What I'm Learning & Building
- Mastering Solidity through **CryptoZombies** (completed early lessons) and **Patrick Collins' Foundry Course** (Cyfrin Updraft – in progress).
- Completed: **Mastering Web3 MOOC** (University of Nicosia).
- Midway through **Python Specialization** (on Coursera).
- Experimenting with Python and Blockchain technology.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Solidity, Python, HTML/CSS basics
- **Tools**: Remix IDE, Foundry, Hardhat (learning), GitHub for portfolio
- **Focus**: Smart contracts, DeFi, secure coding practices

### 📂 My Projects
- [Solidity Exersices in](https://github.com/LebsLabs/solidity_workshop) – Early CryptoZombies exercises with Ethereum NatSpec.
- [Data Extortion in Python](https://github.com/LebsLabs/cyprus-grants-collector_python). 

More projects coming soon: Chainlink-integrated FundMe, Raffle dApps, and full DeFi prototypes!

### 🌱 Goals
- Build a strong portfolio of deployed smart contracts on testnets (Sepolia, etc.).
- Contribute to open-source web3 projects.
- Freelance/collaborate on Solidity gigs (open to US/EU clients).
