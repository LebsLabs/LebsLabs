## Hi there 👋, Welcome to LebsLabs

Aspiring **Blockchain Developer**.

Currently building my skills in Ethereum smart contract development & improving my Python expertise with some hands-on learning by building automation programs. 

### What I'm Learning? How I'm Learning?
- SOLIDITY through **CryptoZombies** and **Patrick Collins**.
Past/Current/ planed PROJECTs: De-Lottery 
- PYTHON through **Python Specialization** offered by University of Michigan. ### I think prof.dr. Chuck S. is a great teacher! 
- Past/Current/ planed PROJECTs: Right now working on a web scraper which represents quite a challenge for an intermediate Python developer as the webpages are numerous, descriptive and each has tags structured in a its own way. 

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Solidity is my major while python my minor :)
- html, css ...of course 
- **Tools**: VS Code, WSL, Remix IDE, Foundry, Hardhat, GitHub, Alchemy/ChainLink 
- **Focus**: Smart contracts & security + Python automation. 

### 📂 My Projects

- [Smart contract Programing with Foundry](https://github.com/LebsLabs/foundry-fund-me-course-f26)
- [Smart Contract Programming with tools like ide remix](https://github.com/LebsLabs/smart-foundry)
- [Solidity Exersices in](https://github.com/LebsLabs/zombies-solidity-exercise) 
- [Data Extortion in Python](https://github.com/LebsLabs/web-data-extraction) 

More projects coming soon: Raffle dApps, and full DeFi prototypes!

### 🌱 Goals
- Build a strong portfolio of deployed smart contracts on testnets (Sepolia, etc.).
- Contribute to open-source web3 projects.
- Freelance/collaborate on Solidity gigs.
